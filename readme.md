Dependency Injection (DI) in Spring Boot is a design pattern that allows objects to be injected into a class,
rather than the class creating the object itself. This promotes loose coupling and enhances testability and maintainability.
Let's explain this with the example of some parts of StarBucks business.

**Starbucks Business Logic**
The goal of the Starbucks service in this example is to process orders for customers,
including payment processing and shipping of the order. The business logic is encapsulated
in the StarbucksService class, which depends on two services: PaymentProcessor and ShippingService.

1. **PaymentProcessor Interface**
   The PaymentProcessor interface defines the contract for processing payments.
   This interface allows for different implementations of payment processing
   (e.g., credit card, PayPal, etc.) without changing the dependent classes.
2. **ShippingService Interface**
   The ShippingService interface defines the contract for shipping orders. 
   Similarly, this interface allows for different implementations of shipping logistics.
3. **Implementations of Interfaces**
   Concrete implementations of the interfaces provide the actual business logic. Such as:
   payment service and shipping service
4. The StarbucksService class orchestrates the process of handling an order by utilizing
   the PaymentProcessor and ShippingService.
   **Constructor Injection:** 
      The StarbucksService class uses constructor injection to receive its dependencies.
      This approach is preferred because it makes the dependencies explicit and immutable.
   **Business Logic:**
      The deliverOrder method handles the payment processing and shipping,
      coordinating between the different services to complete an order.

How Dependency Injection (DI) Helps in the Starbucks Business Logic

**Loose Coupling**:
The business logic in StarbucksService relies on abstractions (PaymentProcessor and ShippingService interfaces) rather than concrete implementations.
This makes it easy to replace or update the payment and shipping logic without changing the StarbucksService.

**Flexibility**:
Different implementations of PaymentProcessor and ShippingService can be created
(e.g., CreditCardPaymentProcessor, PayPalPaymentProcessor, FedExShippingService, DHLShippingService).
These can be injected into StarbucksService based on configuration, enabling flexibility.

**Testability**:
By using DI, you can easily create mock implementations of PaymentProcessor and ShippingService for unit testing.
This allows you to test the StarbucksService independently of the actual payment and shipping implementations.

**Maintainability**:
The clear separation of concerns and reliance on interfaces means that each component can be
developed, tested, and maintained independently. This reduces the risk of changes in one part
of the system affecting other parts.

**Scalability**:
As the business grows, new payment methods or shipping providers can be added with minimal
changes to the existing codebase. This scalability is facilitated by the DI framework
managing the dependencies.

The Starbucks business logic, as implemented with DI, is more modular, flexible, and maintainable.
By injecting dependencies, the StarbucksService class remains focused on orchestrating the business
process without being tightly coupled to specific implementations of payment and shipping services.
This approach enhances testability, allows easy replacement or extension of services, and results
in a more robust and scalable system.
